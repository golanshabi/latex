\subsection*{Question}
Suppose we are given one machine and a set of jobs that arrive over time. The machine can process one job at a time and may preempt jobs. The duration of a job is known at its release time and the benefit of a job is equal to its duration. In order to get the benefit of a job it must be processed immediately at its release time and should not be preempted until its completion.
