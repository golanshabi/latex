\subsection{Question}
Show an $O(\log k)$ competitive algorithm where the goal is to minimize the maximum group volume
(group volume is the total load of machines in a group).

\subsection{Answer}
w.l.o.g assume that $\lambda = OPT$ is 1, otherwise we can normalize it.\\
Note that it doesn't matter to which machine we put in a group, so we will use a 
more general notion of putting in a group and not in a specific machine.\\
We will use the algorithm $A$ which operates in the following way: \\
It will choose the group $j$ for job $i$ based on which minimizes group the following $ a^{v_j + w_{ij}} - a^{v_j} $, where $v_j$ is the current volume of group $j$ and $a$ is the same as we defined in class.\\
Note that since it doesn't matter which machine we choose, this problem is equivalent to the one we saw in class. And we know that the solution is $O(\log k)$ competitive. as requested.\\
