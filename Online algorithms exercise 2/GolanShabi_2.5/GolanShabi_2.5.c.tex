\subsection{Question}
Show a lower bound for minimizing the maximum load over all machines of $\Omega(\log k)$ for any k
and r.
\subsection{Answer}
We saw that the Unrelated Machines problem is generalization of Restricted Assignment model and the Related machines model.\\
Like in Part a we know that the problem given here is equivalent to the one we saw in class. This implies that the lower bound of this problem is the same to the Unrelated Machines problem.\\
But since the unrelated machines problem is a generalization of the Restricted Assignment model and the Related machines model, we can use the maximum of the lower bounds of these 2 problems.\\
The lower bound we saw for the Restricted Assignment model is $ \lceil \log k \rceil + 1 $ and for the Related machines model is $8$.\\
This implies that the lower bound for this problem is $\Omega(\log k)$ as requested.
